# Dent Proof-of-concept

Dent is an idea for using the same logic-less Rails templates for rendering
both Rails views and rendering Mustache version for use on the front end. The
main objective is to eliminate view duplication.

To get set up to see it in action:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtrim/dent-poc.git
cd dent-poc
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s
```
